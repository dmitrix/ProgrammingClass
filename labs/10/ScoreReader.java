    Write a program that reads the file, Scores.txt, and then displays the following items in a nice, user-friendly format to both the screen and an output file named, Results.txt:
      *Title
      *Highest Score
      *Lowest Score
      *Average Score
      *Number of Scores Read

    The file format is a text file that has the Title for what these scores represent (like Exam 1) followed by a list of scores where there is 1 score per line. Your code should catch all files that do not have a Title line in the file and still process the scores and include a notation in the output that no Title was found in the file (You only have to worry about the title in the first row of the file).
