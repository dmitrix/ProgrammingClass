# ProgrammingClass FAQ

## What is this all about?

This is simply a place where I "push" Java code. Each folder may be it's own program independent of the other programs and folders so there's no real organization here. It's just a place where I can write down random code for testing, practice and/or learning and have it all in one place.

## Why Java?

I know, I hate Java too. I'm taking an actual programming class in college that's taught in Java. I feel bad because I used to know it quite well when I was younger. So here is where I practice and try to get better than my younger self. Also, Java is similar to C# which is a language that I would like to use.

## Why are you trying to maintain a streak on GitHub?

Programming is something I have always studied on and off. Meaning, in the past I would study programming for months and then stop for months. When I undergo long periods of time when I don't program at all I feel like I loose a lot of what I have learned and have to start all over again. It's easy for me to catch up to where I was but it's a major impedance to progress. So my hope is that maintaining a streak on GitHub will help me to program often and to constantly learn and improve.

## Why don't you just give up on programming? Why don't you just focus on something else like machining?

I have a special affinity for programming. Before I started programming I had no particular reason to be interested in Math or Science. Even if I did, I lacked the self confidence to believe that I could be successful. Programming showed me that I was capable of learning things that were considered difficult. I found joy in programming and it motivated me to take other things more seriously. So I still wish to continue my studies in it.

In addition, CNC machines run off code. While G-Code may be different than Java, my experience in programming has definately helped.

## Isn't this called ProgrammingClass? Where are your homework assignments?

Sorry man. I'm not going to post my homework assignments. At least not right now. Maybe later.

EDIT: Okay, maybe... maybe there are assignments on here. Shh, don't tell anyone. Please

## How'd you get so good at Git?

This XKCD comic describes exactly how I use / learn Git.
