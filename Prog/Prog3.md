# Prog. 3

## The Problem

I am bad at Physics. There are multiple concepts, equations, laws, units and vocabulary that I need to learn in order to do well. So I need a better way to learn and memorize these things. In addition, various different equations can be derived from one single equation in order to explain all sorts of things. So I need a better way to become familiar with equations in different forms.

## The Solution

A flash card program that will test my knowledge of physics and help me know what areas I need to focus on.

## One Step Further

The flash card program is packaged in an applet that also contains a small physics sandbox "game". This game demonstrates concepts such as gravity, inertia, friction, etc through interactive animations. The user will be able to input values such as friction coefficients or mass in order to get different out comes. 

## User Stories 

1. Meet Bob. He's having a difficult time learning physics and comprehending Newton's second law. So Bob turns to this super great new Java program for help. Upon opening the program Bob is faced with an aesthetically pleasing main menu. He considers his options and clicks on the first menu item which leads him to explanations of physics concepts. He navigates to Newton's law and finds an easy to understand explanation. Bob then tests his new found knowledge with the flash card portion of the program and finds that now he does comprehend Newton's second law. Bob then sends Marcel a snapchat of a thumbs up. :+1:
